              <div class="title">How to handle loading of images that may not exist</div>
              <p>When you are handling millions of images on your website or mobile application, it is quite possible
                that over a period of time, a few images may cease to exist. And when you try to deliver those images on
                your applications, the users end up seeing a broken image like the one below.A sample page with broken
                images as seen on Google Chrome browserDefinitely, this is not something that you would want showing up
                on your application. There are a few ways on how you can fix this broken image problem to maintain the
                UX standards of your application.1. Periodic data cleanupIf an image does not exist, then it should be
                removed from the database.An image URL that is incorrect or points to an image that no longer exists, is
                most likely a data issue. So the first thing that you can do to counter the broken image problem is to
                periodically check all images for sanity. You would pick up a list of image URLs that have been added
                over let’s say the last week and check if you are able to retrieve those images (a 200 OK HTTP
                response). If yes, then the image stays in your database, else you can discard the image.Advantages
                —&nbsp;Solves the problem at the root level. One-time effort in writing the scriptDisadvantages
                —&nbsp;Lengthy execution times (nearly impossible) for millions of images, waste of network bandwidth
                and cannot catch errors for the time between two consecutive runs of the cleanup task.2. Handle it in
                your applicationIf an image does not exist, we can replace it with a new one.Another way to handle this
                issue is by listening to the error event that gets fired when the image fails to load. In HTML, this can
                be done with the&nbsp;onerror&nbsp;attribute of the&nbsp;&lt;img&gt;&nbsp;tag.&lt;img
                src="http://example.com/non-existent-image.jpg"
                onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='http://example.com/existent-image.jpg';" /&gt;
                If the original image fails to load, then it is replaced by the image mentioned in
                the&nbsp;onerror&nbsp;attribute handler. Similar handling can be done in mobile apps as well.Advantages
                —&nbsp;Can handle data issues in real-time, no need for periodic checksDisadvantages —&nbsp;Won’t work
                for images loaded as background (at least for websites). Problems may continue in older versions of your
                website or application that cannot be updated with the new code. Different code for different
                platforms.3. Handle it on your image serverIf the image does not exist, then the server should not send
                the error at all.Your image server knows if an image does not exist and sends a 404 Not Found HTTP
                status code to the client. Instead, the server itself could replace it with a default image, correct the
                HTTP status code and then send it to the browser or the application.Advantages—&nbsp;Works in real time
                without any periodic checks. No handling needed on any application or any version of any application.
                Works for all kinds of imagesDisadvantages —&nbsp;You need to build a server that can handle this
                rerouting for you. Difficult, if not impossible, to get it working with simple image delivery setups
                like CDN + S3 storage.4. Handle it using a third-party image server like
                ImageKit.ioImageKit.io&nbsp;automatically provides server-side handling of non-existent images.
                Using&nbsp;ImageKit’s&nbsp;URL-based transformations, you can specify the default image that should be
                delivered, if the original image does not exist, with the original image URL itself. To give an
                example,&lt;!-- The non-existent image URL --&gt;
                &lt;img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/demo/img/non_existent_image.jpg" /&gt;

                &lt;!-- Specifying the default image to be displayed in the URL --&gt;
                &lt;img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/demo/img/tr:di-medium_cafe_B1iTdD0C.jpg/non_existent_image.jpg"
                /&gt;
                The default image is specified using the&nbsp;di-&nbsp;parameter in the URL. In this case, the default
                image is from a cafe.Deliver a default image, the one on the right, instead of the broken image, the one
                on the left.Being a URL-transformation, this gives you the flexibility to specify a different default
                image for different kinds of images without having to write any code to handle the error cases. You can
                read more about&nbsp;handling of non-existent images or default images using ImageKit
                here.Considerations for image caching in error casesDefault images sent instead of a non-existent image
                should not be cached at all or if it is cached, then the cache duration should be small, preferably a
                few hours. This leaves an opportunity for the non-existent image to be “fixed” or made available. When
                this happens, then the correct image would start getting delivered to the users automatically. However
                if the image is not expected to be fixed, then the cache duration can be longer.Considerations for
                response code in error casesIf you wish to handle the error case in your application, then the image
                request should be returned with a 404 status code for the&nbsp;onerror&nbsp;to work. If you are
                delivering the default image instead of a broken image from the server, then the response code can be
                302 Temporarily Moved (ideally to prevent caching on intermediate layers like CDN but handling with
                success and error handlers in application is impaired) or 200 OK (caching on intermediate layers can be
                controlled with caching headers)</p>
